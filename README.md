Using data set J1136+1551_20100106_hi.xlsx for astro.R

The data set J1136+1551_20100106_hi provides the values of on-pulse and off-pulse energies for a pulse sequence of length 1000 for J1136+1551 pulsar. The on-pulse energies are expected to have two components, viz. null component (expected to have Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance as the off-pulse energies) and the non-null com-
ponent (which can have wide range of shapes). The aim of the analysis is to estimate the Nulling Fraction (proportion of the null component).
